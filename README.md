# SQLQuery

## Coding Assignment

Please ensure that you have installed required IDE on your computer before embarking on this assignment.
You may take a maximum of 4-8 hour to complete this assignment.


Create object-oriented, scalable, loosely coupled code, and try to look for opportunities to reuse code.
Use Design patterns wherever appropriate

Use the best industry practices for commenting, code layout, coding style and naming of objects, members, and methods.
A simple console application/ a command line application will suffice.
Send us completed solutions by email in zipped format with a maximum file size of 2 MB; also send us the JSON file that you had created during this assignment.
  Or provide your solutions  pushed to a public github repository and send us the link  along with any test JSON file
 
 
* ### Problem 1: Create a SQL query supporting various operators ( IN, LIKE, =, <=, >= , <>, BETWEEN etc)

Assume the application you write can have a JSON in the below format to parse and create the expression
```
{"columns":[{"operator":"IN","fieldName":"column1","fieldValue":"value"},{"operator":"Equal","fieldName":"column2","fieldValue":"value"}}
```
As part of your assignment, please write code to implement the following functionalities: -
  Read the JSON file.
  Create an SQL QUERY as an output.
* ### Problem 2: 
Extend the program further to support querying from multiple tables i.e., add support for sub-query or joins in the query builder

The idea of this problem should be to provide a generic solution to build SQL Query supporting any number of tables.

## Programming Languages allowed :
* Java
* C#.Net
* Any other Oriented Programming Language


## Additional notes:
You are allowed to use whatever libraries/parsers/solutions you can find provided you can explain the functions you are implementing in detail.
