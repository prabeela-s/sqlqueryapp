# SQLQuery

## Coding Assignment

Please ensure that you have installed required IDE on your computer before embarking on this assignment.
You may take a maximum of 8-12 hour to complete this assignment.

* Create object-oriented, scalable, loosely coupled code, and try to look for opportunities to reuse code.
* Use Design patterns wherever appropriate
* Use the best industry practices for commenting, code layout, coding style and naming of objects, members, and methods.
* A simple console application/ a command line application will suffice.
 
 
* ### Problem 1: Create a SQL query supporting various operators ( IN, LIKE, =, <=, >= , <>, BETWEEN etc)

Assume the application you write can have a JSON in the below format to parse and create the expression
```
{"columns":[{"operator":"IN","fieldName":"column1","fieldValue":"value"},{"operator":"Equal","fieldName":"column2","fieldValue":"value"}}
```
As part of your assignment, please write code to implement the following functionalities: -
  * Read the JSON file.
  * Create an SQL QUERY as an output.
* ### Problem 2: 
Extend the program further to support querying from multiple tables i.e., add support for sub-query or joins in the query builder

The idea of this problem should be to provide a generic solution to build SQL Query supporting any number of tables.

## Programming Languages allowed :
* Java
* C#.Net
* Any other Object Oriented Programming Language


## Additional notes:
You are allowed to use whatever libraries/parsers you can find provided you can explain the functions you are implementing in detail.
